pip install Django - downloaded Django, but gave out a bunch of exceptions and never returned ‘Successfully installed Django”

after some research I ran the 
	
sudo pip install django - which returned “Successfully installed django-1.11.5”

pip list - printed a list of my installed packages

pip install Django - returned “Requirement already satisfied” and files location

pip freeze - returned the list of my packages in machine-like syntax
             help says it “Output installed packages in requirements format.”
             StackOverflow explains the difference as “pip list include editables 
             which pip freeze does not.”

pip freeze > requirements.txt - created a txt file on my desktop, that contains
                          the “Output installed packages in requirements format.”

again had to run 

sudo pip uninstall Django - to get “Successfully uninstalled Django-1.11.5”

pip show Django - gets ignored prompting me back to a new command line
                  (same with sudo and sudo -H)

pip search Flask - returns a long list with comments explaining what each item is
